Requires feh for displaying the images fetched from xkcd.com
You can find a binary in the releases section of this repo.

I recommend you to have a special directory just for the snapshots of the comics as they will be downloaded in the directory you are in.

All comics can be found at https://xkcd.com/ Randall Munroe is the author of this comic so, the credit goes for him.
