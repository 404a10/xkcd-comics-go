# xkcd-comics-go
Read xkcd comics from the confort of your terminal!

![Previsualization](/images/preview.png)

Requires feh for displaying the images fetched from xkcd.com (It can be disabled with --no-display).
You can find a binary in the releases section of this repo.

I recommend you having a specific directory just for the snapshots of the comics as they will be downloaded in the directory you are in.

### TODO 
- [ ] Add an option for displaying the images without downloading.

All comics can be found at https://xkcd.com/ Randall Munroe is the author of this comic so, the credit goes for him.
